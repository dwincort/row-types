## Type Surgery

I read about the idea of "data type surgery" on
[Lysxia's blog post of the same name](https://blog.poisson.chat/posts/2018-11-26-type-surgery.html).
I'll quote from the blog:

> The general motivation is to improve the applicability of various generic definitions,
> such as aesonâ€™s generic instances for `ToJSON` and `FromJSON`. Such a library often
> offers several options to customize the generic implementations, but it can still
> happen that none of them quite fit your external requirements and you have to resort
> to manual implementations, even with only small mismatches with the generic
> implementations. Surgeries are a new way to adapt generic implementations to such
> conditions outside of your control.

As it turns out, one can gain the same powers from the row-types package
(something Lysxia hinted at in a footnote in the original blog).  Today, I'm going
to demonstrate how to use row-types to do type surgery.

## Example

<details class="code-details">

<summary>Extensions and imports for this Literate Haskell file</summary>

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedLabels #-}
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}
{-# LANGUAGE PartialTypeSignatures #-}
module TypeSurgery where

import qualified Data.Row.Records as Rec

import Data.Aeson
import Data.Coerce            (coerce)
import Data.Functor.Identity  (Identity(..))

import GHC.Generics

-- Convenient lens functions (rather than importing Lens)
over :: ((a -> Identity b) -> s -> Identity t) -> (a -> b) -> s -> t
over = coerce
```
</details>

I'll use the same example given in Lysxia's blog:

```haskell
data RecToy = RecToy
  { iden     :: Int
  , header1  :: Int
  , header2  :: Int
  , payload  :: String
  } deriving (Eq, Show, Generic)
```

Here we have a toy record for which we'd like to generate a `FromJSON` instance,
but we have a condition: the `payload` field is allowed to be optional in the
JSON (i.e., a missing field should be parsed as the empty string `""`).  Aeson's
generic instances work fine with optional fields _so long as they are `Maybe`
fields_, so there seems to be no easy solution.  We could make an alternate
`RecToy'` whose `payload` field is a `Maybe String` and then convert it, but that's
a lot of boilerplate.  We could also write our own `FromJSON` instance manually,
but that's tedious.

So, let's do some surgery!

## generic-data-surgery
Lyxsia describes the following solution using the generic-data-surgery library:

```haskell
instance FromJSON RecToy where
  parseJSON :: Value -> Parser RecToy
  parseJSON
    = fmap ( fromOR
           . modifyRField @"payload" defString
           . toOR')
    . genericParseJSON defaultOptions{omitNothingFields=True}

defString :: Maybe String -> String
defString = maybe "" id
```

The key part here is the surgery going on in:

```haskell
fromOR . modifyRField @"payload" defString . toOR'
```

Let's break this down:

- First, we head into the "operating room" with `toOR'`.

- Then, we modify the record field named `payload` by applying the `defString`
  function to it.

- Finally, we exit the "operating room" with `fromOR`.

Behind the scenes at the type level, the `genericParseJSON` is being done on a
synthetic type that looks just like `RecToy` but where the `payload` field has
the type `Maybe String`.  This synthetic type is lifted into the "operating room",
which is essentially lifting it into a manipulatable type and then "operated on",
where the `payload` field is converted from type `Maybe String` to `String` using
the `defString` function.  Finally, `fromOR` converts this manipulatable type
to `RecToy`, and parsing is complete.

## row-types Solution
For a simple case like this, we can do almost the same thing with row-types.
The main difference is that what generic-data-surgery calls an operating room,
we simply call a row-types record (or variant).  Indeed, instead of going to and
from the OR, we can go to and from the native type using `Rec.toNative` and
`Rec.fromNative`.  Specifically:

- Because row-types records are generic themselves, we don't actually need an operation
  like `toOR'`.  The result of `genericParseJSON` will be inferred as the
  appropriate row-types record directly, and we can start with the expression
  to modify it.

- In place of `modifyRField @"payload" defString`, we do a lensy operation
  to change the record.  In this case, we could write
  `over (Rec.focus #payload) defString`.

- Finally, we convert back to a Haskell native type with `Rec.toNative`.

The full code looks like:
```haskell
instance FromJSON RecToy where
  parseJSON :: Value -> Parser RecToy
  parseJSON
    = fmap ( Rec.toNative
           . over (Rec.focus #payload) defString)
    . genericParseJSON defaultOptions{omitNothingFields=True}
```

## Limitations
The row-types library is limited compared to generic-data-surgery in two specific
ways: there are no conversion functions between full sum-of-products Haskell
data types and variants of records, and there is no support for unnamed fields.
The first limitation is simply because such a feature has never seemed necessary
to row-types, and it could be added with a little generics programming.

The second is a more fundamental limitation.  Names are critical to the concept
of the row-types library, as every field in a record and every possibility in a
variant must be named.  Therefore, it is simply impossible to convert a native
record that has no field names into a row-types record (without a lot of defaulting).
